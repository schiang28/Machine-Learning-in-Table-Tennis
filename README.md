# Machine-Learning-in-Table-Tennis

Abstract—Machine learning, classification and prediction models have applications across a range of fields. Sport analytics is one such increasingly popular field, but most existing work focuses on automated refereeing and injury prevention in main- stream sports. Research on other sports, such as table tennis, have only recently started gaining more traction. In this paper, we aim to predict the outcome of table tennis matches; we valuate a range of existing supervised machine learning models to find a reliable predictor, trained on historical player and match statistics. We also derive 12 features and demonstrate their utility in an ablation study. We found that logistic regression performed best on the test data, although differences between models were not always significant. Our results match the accuracy of state-of-the-art in comparable sports, such as tennis.

Impact Statement—The use of supervised learning models has been proposed for outcome prediction in a number of sports; however, there has been little research done for table tennis. This paper extends the application field in this direction, rigorously evaluating existing models. Furthermore, we also present a set of additional features that increase model accuracy, as validated in the ablation study. The results can serve as a baseline for future table tennis prediction models, and can feed back to prediction research in similar ball sports.
