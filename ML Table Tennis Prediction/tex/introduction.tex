\section{Introduction}
Table tennis is a quick and highly technical sport, requiring players to respond to a perceived incoming ball trajectory within milliseconds. Rallies are unusually intense,  having ball speeds of 60--70mph and a rotational speed of 9000rpm. The proximity between players is also a lot lower compared to other sports such as tennis and badminton. The  outcome of a game can be influenced by subtle factors, which can be hard for a human to recognise.
%The possible inaccuracy in human decision making has thus lead to the application of machine learning techniques to sport result prediction.

Machine learning methods have been used frequently  in other sports, such as tennis and football. Proposed applications involve improved training efficiency

as well as result prediction. Specifically, result prediction is of high concern to sport fans, but little has been done in table tennis prediction.
%, the main reason being is the lack of available match data.  GXD: this is an important point, but here it almost implies that this paper adds dat


While manually-collected datasets alongside some analysis have been available in the past \cite{wang2019tac}, it is only recent developments in  multi-class event spotting and small object tracking that made accurate, detailed in-game data attainable.
In this paper, we propose using some of this freshly available data to train and evaluate  state-of-the-art classification algorithms on both men and women's professional singles matches. %Player statistics collected from historical matches are predominantly used in predicting the outcome, with newly derived information calculated from combining player statistics.

%The main contributions of this paper are:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item a quantitative evaluation of different ML models for table tennis match prediction
%    \item  an investigation on engineering new features from the raw data
%\end{itemize}

%The main contributions of this paper focuses on bridging the gap between data collection and predictive analysis in table tennis, discussing relevant state-of-the-art machine learning models and reporting the model with the highest predictive performance using rigorous quantitative evaluation. 

The rest of the paper is organised as follows: first we review the relevant publications on sports prediction and we describe the OSAI dataset on which our work is built on. Then, we describe the proposed feature set. Finally, we evaluate the performance of a range of state-of-the-art models with ablation studies and hyperparameter tuning.
