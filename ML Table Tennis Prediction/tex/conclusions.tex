\section{Conclusion} \label{conc}
In this paper, the concepts of machine learning were discussed and how different supervised ML methods and classification algorithms could be used in table tennis match prediction. 
This paper follows a state-of-the art approach in training and evaluating different machine learning models. The theory of each model and how it's performance was evaluated was explained.
The original dataset retrieved from OSAI \cite{OSAI}, in addition to deriving new features were used, and the difference in performance of models with and without newly derived features were compared.
The model which achieved the highest evaluated score when presented with unseen data in the test set was by using logistic regression. From Figure \ref{fig4}, the feature which is shown to be the most important is $RANKDIFF$, a measure of the difference between rank in opponents in an attempt to quantify both players' skill difference. 
Future works could focus on a selection of the most important features established from the random forest model.
