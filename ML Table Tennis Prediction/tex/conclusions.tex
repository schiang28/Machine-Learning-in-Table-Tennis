\section{Conclusion} \label{conc}
In this paper, the concepts of machine learning were discussed and how different supervised ML methods and classification algorithms could be used in table tennis match prediction. 
This paper follows a state-of-the art approach in training and evaluating different machine learning models. We explain the theory behind each model that is used, and how it's performance was evaluated.
The original dataset retrieved from OSAI \cite{OSAI}, in addition to deriving new features were used, and the difference in performance of models with and without newly derived features were compared.
When taking into consideration accuracy and F1 score on the validation and test set, combined with the area under it's ROC curve, the model which achieved the highest evaluated score was by using logistic regression.
From Figure \ref{fig4}, the feature which is shown to be the most important is $RANKDIFF$, a measure of the difference between rank in opponents in an attempt to quantify both players' skill difference. 
Future works could focus on a selection of the most important features established from the random forest model.
