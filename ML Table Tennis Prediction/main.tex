\begin{abstract}
Machine learning has shown to be useful in many different fields of classification and prediction. In this paper, these techniques are applied specifically to predicting the outcome of a table tennis match, and a similar idea has been applied to different sports for arranging effective training for players. Player and match statistics from data on historical matches were used to predict the outcome, and 12 features were extracted and derived in an attempt to capture the quality of players and their opponents. Using logistic regression was found to have the best overall performance when evaluated and presented with unseen data. Furthermore, all predictive models had a higher evaluated performance when newly derived features were used in combination with data extracted from the dataset, in comparison to without using these calculated features.
